    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Anthony Tse. I am currently a research associate at OPKO Diagnostics, LLC, 
      a medical device company. My current project is in developing 
      a testosterone assay for use in a point of care medical setting. Currently, my goal is to return to school to 
      continue my education in computer science. Hopefully one day, I can start a career as a 
      Software Engineer. Until then, I'm starting this page as a way to show case 
      my CS projects. <br/><br/>
      In my spare time, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, running, and snowboarding.
